            <p class="blog-para">
                Usually I would make a website the quick way, using a tool, such as wordpress or joomla combined with premade themes. 
                However, for my portfolio website I decided to tackle a small challenge and <span class="iitalic"> build a website in 1 week </span> from scratch.
                
                In this short post I will explain my process for creating this website in 1 week.

            <p class="blog-chapter"> Learning the basics </p>
            <p class="blog-sub-chapter"> Understand html </p>
            <p class="blog-para">
                This is a pretty straightforward task. A single html file will define the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp">structure</a> and the content of a webpage.
                As an example the text you're reading is written inside a <span class="bbold"> p </span> element inside the html file for this post.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-sub-chapter"> Understand CSS </p>
            <p class="blog-para">
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to write the style of an html page. 
                There are plenty of properties that can be used to define certain styles and layouts, and learning all of them by heart wouldn't make much sense.
                Googling and using the previously mentioned resources would give a very good start on the most used properties.
                <br>
                In my opinion the most important stuff to understand are:
                <div class="blog-todo my-4">
                    <p> <span id="tcircle"></span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp"> Box Model</a>: All html elements are represented as boxes with a padding, margin, border and content. </p>
                    <p> <span id="tcircle"></span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp"> Specificity</a>: All css definitions can be overwritten based on the specificity (to find out how specific a definition is you can use an <a target="_blank" href="https://specificity.keegan.st/">online calculator</a>). </p>
                </div>
            </p>

            <p class="blog-sub-chapter"> Understand Javascript </p>
            <p class="blog-para">
                For a small scope website like this, javascript is a perfect fit for manipulating the website dynamically. This type of use case is known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">DOM Manipulation</a>.
                <br>
                You can modify the html by creating links to every element and apply any kind of change to the element or also remove it completely.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-sub-chapter"> Bootstrap </p>
            <p class="blog-para">
                Bootstrap is a library that uses all the previously mentioned technologies and simplifies the process of creating a website.
                It provides a lot of classes to simplify layout and style of an html page. The best part is that it allows to create a <span class="bbold">responsive</span> website (good looking on every device) very easily.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="bbold"> Don't start with bootstrap. </span> Make sure to have a good grasp of the other technologies first.
                If you start directly with bootstrap you risk not being able to modify the predefined classes to fit your needs. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As an example, this website uses bootsrap almost entirely for the responsive and layout features. All the styling is self defined using CSS. 
                In this way it is hardly noticeable that this website is made using bootstrap.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-quote"> 
                This part was the most time consuming part. 
                I watched the frontend part of the udemy tutorial [1] and the youtube video [2] to understand these technologies.
                In total I spent 4 days for this part.
            </p>   

            

            <p class="blog-chapter"> Designing and implementing the website </p>
            <p class="blog-para">
                After having a good idea of how HTML, CSS, Javascript (and optionally Bootstrap) work, you have to define the style of your website.
                To be entirely honest I didn't know how I wanted the website to look. I had a rough idea in mind and I started iterating over the design multiple times.
                <br>
                <br>

                But I knew for sure that I wanted to have:
                <div class="blog-todo my-4">
                    <p> <span id="tbox"><span id="x">0</span></span> a <span class="bbold"> minimal and responsive </span> website </p>
                    <p> <span id="tbox"><span id="x">1</span></span> a <span class="bbold"> dark mode </span> (for people like me who prefer dark mode on every editor) </p>
                    <p> <span id="tbox"><span id="x">2</span></span> an <span class="bbold"> easy way to add blog posts </span> and have them dynamically show up </p>
                    <p> <span id="tbox"><span id="x">3</span></span> an option to <span class="bbold"> filter the dynamically added posts </span> using predefined tags </p>
                </div>

                <div class="blog-sub-chapter">Achieve goal 0: minimal and responsive</div>
                <p class="blog-para">
                    I tried not having more than 3 base colors. Keeping most of the stuff minimal and without overdoing with fancy layouts.
                    The color palette was found using <a target="_blank" href="https://colorhunt.co/"> color hunt</a>.
                    
                    <br>
                    Responsiveness is mostly handled with bootstrap, but in some occasions I had to hard code the placements of certain elements <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp"> using css media queries</a>:
                    <pre><code class="css blog-code">
/* On screens that are 1200px or less, set the background color to red */
@media screen and (max-width: 1200px) {
  body {
    background-color: red;
  }
}
                    </code></pre>

                </p>


                <div class="blog-sub-chapter">Achieve goal 1: dark mode</div>
                <p class="blog-para">
                    It is a good practice to define a color palette using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp"> css variables</a> in a separate css file. 
                    This variables are then used inside the main css file. The html page loads then the variables and the main css styiling sheet. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To get dark mode woking I created <span class="iitalic"> two variables sheets </span> (one for light and one for dark mode).
                    Using javascript it is then possible to define which variables sheet to load in the html page. 
                    
                    In javascript a variable defines which theme is currently selected (by default it is light). A switch button is also linked in the javascript. 
                    When the user presses the button the theme is changed and it is stored inside the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp">localstorage</a>.
                    In this way the theme will be persistent across all the pages and saved in the browser.

                    <br>
                    Here is a snippet:
                </p>   
                    <pre><code class="js blog-code">
let theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
if (theme == null) {
    setTheme('light');
} else
{
    setTheme(theme);
}

// ...

function setTheme(mode) {
    if (mode == 'dark')
    {
        // change stylesheet
        document.getElementById('theme-style').href = '/css/partials/_variables_dark.css';
    } 
    //...
}
                    </code></pre>
                <p class="blog-para">
                    <br>
                    Also notice that the images in the main page are <span class="bbold"> not .png or .jpg </span>.
                    Since I knew that I wanted the images to be affected by the theme of the website I <span class="bbold">converted the 
                    .png images into .svg </span> using <a target="_blank" href="https://convertio.co/it/png-svg/">convertio</a>.
                    Afterwards I used <a target="_blank" href="https://icomoon.io/">iconmoon</a> to create a font. 
                    This font is actually a collection of the images I used in the website and the nice thing is that all css font properties can be used 
                    on these images. So changing the color is a matter of using the <span class="iitalic">color</span> property in css.
                </p>

                    <div class="blog-sub-chapter">Achieve goal 2: Dynamic blog posts</div>
                    <div class="blog-para">
                        I didn't want to add all the information for each blog post manually inside the html. 
                        Instead I wanted to have an automatic way of showing the blog posts in the projects section. 
                        <br> <br>
                        This made it also easy to add logic for not showing more than 5 posts in the main page, but showing a <span class="iitalic"> show more </span>
                        button which would redirect to a new page with all the projects.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally this approach allows to sort the blog posts in any order using javascript.
                        <br><br>
                        Since the scope of this project is not very big I decided to take a simple approach and use a <span class="bbold">.json</span> file which would contain 
                        all the information for every blog post:
                        
                        <div class="blog-table mb-5">
                            <table>

                                  <th>BlogPost Id</th>

                        A javascript file reads all the content using <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">fetch</a>, creates a blogPost object for every entry in the file, saves them into an array
                        and sorts the array from most recent to least recent. Finally based on the filtering option, not more than 5 cards are shown in the projects section.

                        Filtering becomes as simple as this:

                I managed to make this work but unfortunately when pressing a menu item there is a small flickering in the active states. 
                Since I don't find this to be a big deal I decided to not spend time to solve it. 
                Funny enough I realised that also some websites using elementor in wordpress have this issue.

                <br><br>
                This concludes the journey of creating this website in 1 week. I'm happy I decided to work on the website from scratch.
                It was a very rewarding experience, and I finally can say that I have some idea about web desing.
