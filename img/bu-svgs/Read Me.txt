The actual sponsor icons are used in the following way:

- png images are converted to svg using https://convertio.co/
- svg are passed into iconmoon to create a font 

- iconmoon-style.css inside the css directory is referenced in the index.html
- this stylesheet references the fonts directory placed in the root to access the sponsor logos (which are the svgs transformed into fonts using iconmoon).
